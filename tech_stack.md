# Chosen Technology Stack

## Frontend:
- **Framework:** Electron (for cross-platform desktop application development)
- **UI Framework:** React (for building the user interface)

## Backend:
- **Language:** Python (for file system operations, data processing, AI integration)
- **Framework:** Flask (for a lightweight local server to handle backend logic and AI communication)

## Database:
- **Type:** SQLite (for local, embedded database to store file catalog and index)

## Reasoning:
- **Electron/React:** Provides cross-platform compatibility, a rich ecosystem for UI development, and allows for a modern, responsive user interface.
- **Python/Flask:** Offers powerful capabilities for file system interaction, data parsing, and seamless integration with AI/ML libraries. Flask is lightweight and suitable for a local backend service.
- **SQLite:** A serverless, self-contained database ideal for desktop applications, providing efficient local storage and retrieval of catalog data.
